Physical Computing Project

This project is wearble device that you can control from your phone and the internet.

Stuff it does;
-Lights up random colours
-Flashes blue when you send a tweet
-Lights up bright white when you send it a command (to be used as a flashlight)

To build this project you will need:
- Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE
- Adafruit NeoPixel FeatherWing
- Male Header pins
- Female header pins (buying the ones made for the feather is best to keep the project slim)
- A smart phone

--- Optional ---
- lipo battery
- JST jack cable (for the battery, if it doesn't already come with one)
- 2 push buttons
- Some Protoboard/stripboard/wires (to attach the other components to)
- Temprature sesnor
- Wires
- Some sort of case to keep it in when you're done

Connect components up like so:
(note it may be easier to stack the feather and featherwing)
(the battery is shown as not connected on the schematic, just plug it into the side of the feather)
